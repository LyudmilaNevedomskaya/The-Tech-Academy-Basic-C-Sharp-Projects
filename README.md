# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

### During C# education course I've learned a lot of theory and made different practice exercises.

**These are some _small projects_ I made using C# and .NET Framework**


- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/LyudmilaNevedomskaya/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
- [Twenty One Game](https://github.com/LyudmilaNevedomskaya/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOneGame)

#### Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

#### Twenty One Game

Twenty-one is a famous card game where you must go measuring and buying cards who get closer to 21 wins, however, if you pass 21, you lost! In this console game user will be asked how much money he/she brought and will be able to place a bet. Depending on the game result the user can increase or lose money.
